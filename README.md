**Intro**

This project demonstrates how we can measure the performance of solution based on messaging technology from [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus).

The main idea of this project is to show how to use built-in parameters of NServiceBus that could increase the productivity of your solution without additional efforts.

Of course you can reuse it for your own ideas, business or pet projects.

We have a simple project that uses [nBomber](https://nbomber.com/) for generating messages that will send to our NServiceBus solution

The database should be deployed in MS SQL.
